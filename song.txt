We hold by skinny hands
Trying to warm what age has chilled
Weary wintry lands
Where breaths collapse, arise and thrill

Our sighs fly high above
The sea leaves salty licks and pale lips for the weak
We no longer let us love

Be the end of heartache
Be the end of heartache
Be the ember, anew us
This dark water drags us together
